								<p class="paragraph-2 margin-b-16">The global outlook has brightened in 2024 despite some disappointing news along the way. Ronald Temple, Chief Market Strategist, analyzes the forces that stand to impact global markets as the second half of 2024 unfolds, including the results of a razor's-edge US election, China's ongoing housing challenges, and potential Eurozone policy easing.</p>

								<p class="paragraph-2 margin-b-16">Large language models (LLMs) are progressing at breakneck speed, captivating investors and sweeping through markets. However, their tendency to hallucinate and their inherent opacity limit their utility for investment decisions. Small language models (SLMs), in contrast, offer reliability and interpretability. These qualities make SLMs especially well-suited for answering highly specific questions, as this paper demonstrates using a case study on China's housing market slowdown.</p>
